:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::<h1><b>Python Bootcamp</b></h1>::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


Its a python bootcamp repo, following the #100DayOfCode Challange by Dr. Angela Yu in Udemy course. Along with 
course from IIIT Banglore data science course python Bootcamp course.

I have added some of the programs from different coding practice sites like Leetcode and Hackerrank.
All the questions will be available in comment section with # mark above or below the coding section. All the details will be found there.

<h2>#Day 1-5:<h2> Completed Basics like Variable, Data structure like List, Completed coding more than 15 questions asked by the course during this perios.

          problems are available here. check it out.
          
        1. Rock-Paper-Scissor problem readme. <a href="https://replit.com/@ramakrushna8594/rock-paper-scissors-end#README.md">QDescription</a> 

        2. FizzBuzz: Its a fizzbuzz game

        3. Life in Weeks: Convert no of days remaining in your life into months, weeks, days and hours
        
        4. Pizza order: Ordering a pizza from a store.

        5. Leap Year: Leap year checking. Its a generic code. Any random year can be checked.

        6. Love Calculator: By taking two names as input, matching their letters in names and calculate the percentange of        love matching.

        7. BMI Calculator: As its name suggest, BMI calculator helps us to identify whether the weight per height in balance or not. 

        8. Random Password Generation: To make your password strong, you need to add special characters as well as some numbers.
        using random module we can create a strong or intermediate password. This program is all about that. Used Random module and its method. 

<h2>#Day 6-10: This period started the course with function. Build some simple games like Reeborgs game. This is all part of bootcamp course. Its a hands-on program. 
          
          1. Making a square path with Reeborg: https://reeborg.ca/reeborg.html?lang=en&mode=python&menu=worlds%2Fmenus%2Freeborg_intro_en.json&name=Alone&url=worlds%2Ftutorial_en%2Falone.json
          
          2. Hurdles race Reeborg has entered a hurdles race. Make him run the course:
              link to see the code and play the game is here: https://reeborg.ca/reeborg.html?                lang=en&mode=python&menu=worlds%2Fmenus%2Freeborg_intro_en.json&name=Hurdle%201&url=worlds%2Ftutorial_en%2Fhurdle1.json

          3. Paint_Area_Calculator:You are painting a wall. The instructions on the paint can says that 1 can of paint can cover  square meters of wall. Given a random height and width of wall, calculate how many cans of paint you'll need to buy.

          4. Prime Number: Prime numbers are numbers that can only be cleanly divided by themselves and 1.

          5. Caesar-Cipher-Encryption: This program used to send message to a person with encrypted way so that only receiver can detect the message. Because sender and receiver only knows the value of shift.
                                      #plain_text = "hello"
                                      #shift = 5
                                      #cipher_text = "mjqqt"
                                      #print output: "The encoded text is mjqqt
          6. Caesar-Cipher-Decryption:
                                        #cipher_text = "mjqqt"
                                        #shift = 5
                                        #plain_text = "hello"
                                        #print output: "The decoded text is hello"
          7. Grading-System Program:
          
                                     You have access to a database of student_scores in the format of a dictionary. The keys in  student_scores are the names of the students and the values are their exam scores.
                                     Write a program that converts their scores to grades. By the end of your program, 
          8.Armstrong Number: 
                                    153 = 1*1*1 + 5*5*5 + 3*3*3
                                    Sum of cube of its digit is equal to the same no itslef.

<h2>#Day 10-15:

          1. Bidding System:
                Ask user to enter names and bids. Enter those entires in a new dictionary as key and values. Ask user to whether new bidders are available or not. If new bidder available then ask then to enter their name and bids and add them to the dictionay. Find the maximum bidding value of the dictionary.You can add a logo here of a bidding machine. Clear() can be used to clear screen when required like new entries.
