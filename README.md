Its a python bootcamp repo, following the #100DayOfCode Challange by Dr. Angela Yu in Udemy course. Along with 
course from IIIT Banglore data science course python Bootcamp course.

I have added some of the programs from different coding practice sites like Leetcode and Hackerrank.
All the questions will be available in comment section with # mark above or below the coding section. All the details will be found there.

<h1>#Day 1-5:<h1> Completed Basics like Variable, Data structure like List, Completed coding more than 15 questions asked by the course during this perios.

          problems are available here. check it out.
